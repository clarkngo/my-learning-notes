# Domain Knowledge Base: eBay Ads

## 1. Overview

**eBay Ads** is a suite of advertising tools that allows sellers to boost the visibility of their listings across the eBay network. The primary goal is to get sellers' products in front of more active buyers, drive traffic to their listings, and ultimately increase sales velocity.

Unlike off-site advertising (e.g., Google Ads), eBay's advertising solutions are fully integrated into the marketplace platform.

## 2. Core Ad Products

eBay's advertising portfolio is primarily built on two models: **Promoted Listings Standard** and **Promoted Listings Advanced**.

### Promoted Listings Standard (PLS)

This is the most common and lowest-risk advertising model on eBay.

* **Cost Model:** **Cost-Per-Sale (CPS)**
* **How it works:** Sellers choose an "ad rate" (a percentage of the item's final sale price) they are willing to pay. They are **only** charged this fee if a buyer clicks on the promoted ad and then purchases that *same item* within 30 days.
* **Risk Level:** **Low.** If the ad doesn't lead to a sale, you pay nothing.
* **Control:** Limited. You set the ad rate, and eBay's algorithm determines when and where to show your ad based on its relevance, your ad rate, and other factors.
* **Best for:** Sellers who want to protect their profit margins and are willing to pay a commission for a guaranteed sale.

### Promoted Listings Advanced (PLA)

This is a more traditional digital advertising model, similar to Google or Amazon PPC.

* **Cost Model:** **Cost-Per-Click (CPC)**
* **How it works:** Sellers bid on keywords and set a daily budget. They compete in an auction for the top-of-search placement. You are charged **every time** a buyer clicks on your ad, regardless of whether they make a purchase.
* **Risk Level:** **High.** You can spend your entire budget on clicks that do not convert to sales.
* **Control:** **High.** You have granular control over:
    * **Keyword Targeting:** Choose which search terms trigger your ad.
    * **Bidding:** Set the maximum amount you'll pay for a click.
    * **Budgeting:** Set a firm daily spending limit.
* **Best for:** Sellers who want to aggressively target specific keywords, drive maximum traffic, and have experience managing CPC campaigns.

### Comparison: Standard vs. Advanced

| Feature | Promoted Listings Standard (PLS) | Promoted Listings Advanced (PLA) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost Model** | CPS (Cost-Per-Sale) | CPC (Cost-Per-Click) |
| **When You Pay** | Only when an item sells via an ad click. | Every time a user clicks your ad. |
| **Risk** | Low (Pay only on success) | High (Pay for traffic, not sales) |
| **Primary Goal** | Secure sales profitably. | Drive maximum visibility & traffic. |
| **Control** | Low (You set the ad rate) | High (You control bids, keywords, budget) |
| **Placement** | Across the eBay network (search, listings) | Top slot in search results. |

## 3. Key Concepts & Terminology

A glossary of essential terms used in the eBay Ads ecosystem.

* **Ad Rate:** (PLS) The percentage of an item's final selling price (item price + shipping) that a seller agrees to pay if the item sells via a PLS ad.
* **Impressions:** The total number of times your promoted listing has been shown to a buyer on eBay.
* **Clicks:** The total number of times a buyer has clicked on your promoted listing after seeing it.
* **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** The percentage of impressions that resulted in a click.
    * *Formula: `(Clicks / Impressions) * 100%`*
* **Sold:** The number of items sold within 30 days of a click on a promoted listing.
* **Conversion Rate (CVR):** The percentage of clicks that resulted in a sale.
    * *Formula: `(Items Sold / Clicks) * 100%`*
* **Ad Fees:** The total amount you have paid for advertising.
* **Ad Sales:** The total revenue generated from items sold via promoted listings.
* **ACOS (Advertising Cost of Sale):** A key profitability metric. It shows how much you spent on ads for every dollar of revenue you earned from those ads. A lower ACOS is generally better.
    * *Formula: `(Ad Fees / Ad Sales) * 100%`*
* **Daily Budget:** (PLA) The maximum amount you are willing to spend per day on a Promoted Listings Advanced campaign.
* **Bid:** (PLA) The maximum amount you are willing to pay for a single click on a specific keyword.
* **Attribution Window:** The period after a buyer clicks an ad during which a sale can be credited to that ad. For PLS, this is **30 days**.

## 5. Core Strategies & Best Practices

### General Best Practices

1.  **Optimize Listings First:** Ads amplify, they don't fix. A promoted listing will only convert if the underlying listing is strong. Ensure you have:
    * High-quality, multi-angle photos.
    * A clear, keyword-rich title.
    * A competitive price.
    * Completed item specifics.
2.  **Start with Promoted Listings Standard:** For most sellers, PLS is the best starting point. It's low-risk and allows you to gather data on which items benefit most from promotion.
3.  **Use eBay's "Suggested Ad Rate":** When setting up a PLS campaign, eBay provides a suggested ad rate based on what other sellers are bidding for similar items. This is often a good starting point.
4.  **Promote the Right Items:** Don't promote everything. Focus on:
    * **High-demand items**
    * **Items with good profit margins** (that can absorb the ad fee)
    * **Seasonal items**
    * **New listings** (to get initial sales velocity)

### Advanced (PLA) Strategy

1.  **Start with "Broad Match":** Use broad match keywords initially to discover what search terms buyers are *actually* using.
2.  **Monitor Search Query Reports:** Regularly check the search query report to find irrelevant keywords that are costing you money. Add these to your "negative keywords" list.
3.  **Identify & Scale Winners:** Find high-converting keywords and move them into their own "Exact Match" campaigns with higher bids to maximize impression share.
4.  **Watch Your Budget:** CPC campaigns can spend money very quickly. Set a daily budget you are comfortable with and monitor it closely.
