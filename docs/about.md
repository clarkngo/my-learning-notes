Welcome! This site contains my notes and documentation samples built with Jekyll and the Just the Docs theme.

## What this site is

This repository is a minimal template used to demonstrate and keep notes about Jekyll sites. It includes a small set of pages, a `Gemfile` for dependency management, and a GitHub Actions workflow to build and publish the site to GitHub Pages.

## About me

- Name: Clark
- Role: Learner & tinkerer

I use this site to track experiments, collect reference material, and demonstrate simple documentation patterns.
