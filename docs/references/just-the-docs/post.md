This is a sample post to show how a blog-style entry or dated note might look in this site.

## Quick checklist

- Install dependencies with `bundle install`.
- Serve locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
- Edit or add new posts under `_posts/` if you prefer Jekyll's post conventions.

### Example code

```bash
# build and serve locally
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

Enjoy writing notes! This file is just a simple example — move it into `_posts/` and rename it with a `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` prefix to make it a real Jekyll post.
