| Table Program                          | A generic term for pipelines declared with Flink’s relational APIs (Table API or SQL).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Task                                   | In Flink, a task represents the smallest unit of work and is the node of a physical graph. It encapsulates the execution of exactly one parallel instance of an operator or an operator chain, serving as the basic unit executed by Flink’s runtime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| TaskManager                            | A component of the Flink cluster responsible for executing individual tasks within a job and managing their state. TaskManagers handle data processing and, when working in tandem, enable parallelized processing across the cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Temporal Join                          | A type of join operation in Flink that allows you to match events from two or more streams based on their event time or processing time characteristics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Time Window                            | A window defined by a start and end time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Transformation                         | A Transformation is applied on one or more data streams or data sets and results in one or more output data streams or data sets. A transformation might change a data stream or data set on a per-record basis, but might also only change its partitioning or perform an aggregation. While Operators and Functions are the “physical” parts of Flink’s API, Transformations are only an API concept. Specifically, most transformations are implemented by certain Operators. |
| Tumbling Window                        | A window that tumbles forward in time without overlapping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| UID                                    | A unique identifier of an Operator, either provided by the user or determined from the structure of the job. When the Application is submitted this is converted to a UID hash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| UID hash                               | A unique identifier of an Operator at runtime, otherwise known as “Operator ID” or “Vertex ID” and generated from a UID. It is commonly exposed in logs, the REST API or metrics, and most importantly is how operators are identified within savepoints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Watermark                              | A mechanism in Flink used to denote and track progress in event time. It's essential for time-based operations like windowing and handling out-of-order events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Window                                 | A window represents a finite set of data in a stream, divided into fixed or dynamic intervals based on criteria like time, count, or other factors. These intervals facilitate aggregation or analysis of the streaming data. Flink supports various types of windows, including tumbling, sliding, and session windows.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Windowing                              | A technique for dividing data streams into windows of finite size, often used for operations like aggregations and calculations over a subset of the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
